# MongoJS Sorting

## Instructions

* Review the two routes provided to you and speak with a partner about what the code is doing.

  * Get `/`: Displays a simple "Hello World" message (no mongo required).
  
  * Get `/all`: Send JSON response with all animals.

* Make two routes that display results from your zoo collection:

  * Name: Send JSON response sorted by name in ascending order.

  * Weight: Send JSON response sorted by weight in descending order.

## 💡 Hint(s)

* Use the [Mongo guides](https://docs.mongodb.com/guides/) if you are stuck.

## 🏆 Bonus

* Create an additional route that returns the heaviest animal.
