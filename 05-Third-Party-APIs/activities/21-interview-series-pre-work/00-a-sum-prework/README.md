# INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

## Instructions

### Pseudocoding

Complete the Pseudocode for the following Algorithmic Prompts. Pseudocode entails *describing the necessary steps to solve the problem using programming principles* as opposed to *hard-coding* it out. 

**No Coding**

Each step of your algorithm you should make the following items clear: 

```
What are you going to do?
How are you going to do it? 
Why are you going to do it?
```

## Prompt #1 `sum`

Create a function `calculateSum` that takes in an array of integers. 

Your function returns the sum of all integers within the input array.

Note: Complete only the Pseudocode.

### Example

Test Case 1: [1, 2, 5]  
*Expected Output: **8***

Test Case 2: [1, 2, 3, 4]  
*Expected Output: **10***

Test Case 3: [100, 50, 75, 80]  
*Expected Output: **305***

## Prompt #2 `mean`

Create a function `mean` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. 

Your function returns the `mean` / `average` for all integers within the input array.

The mean is the average of a set of numbers, so use your `calculateSum` function defined in Prompt #1 and sum all numbers and then divide by the total number of integers in the input array. 


Note: Complete only the Pseudocode.

### Example
Test Case 1: [1, 2, 5]  
*Expected Output: **2.666...***

Test Case 2: [1, 2, 3, 4]   
*Expected Output: **2.5***

Test Case 3: [100, 50, 75, 80]  
*Expected Output: **76.25***

## Prompt #3 `median`

Create a function `median` that takes in an array of integers as an argument. 

Your function returns the median of your input array.

The median is the middle value, so first you will have to sort the numbers then find the middle value

### Example


Test Case 1: [12, 3 ,5]    
*Expected Output: **5***

Test Case 2: [3, 13, 7, 5, 21, 23, 39, 23, 40, 23, 14, 12, 56, 23, 29]  
*Expected Output: **23***

Test Case 3: [3, 5, 7, 12, 13, 14, 21, 23, 23, 23, 23, 29, 40, 56]  
*Expected Output: **22***

*Note:* In the case where the total number of data points is even, take the average of the two middle numbers.

Test Case 4: [3, 4, 7, 9]  
*Expected Output: **5.5***

*Expected Output: **14***

Test Case 4: [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]   
*Expected Output: **2*** 

*Note:* In the case where all the integers appear with the same frequency, take the first one.
