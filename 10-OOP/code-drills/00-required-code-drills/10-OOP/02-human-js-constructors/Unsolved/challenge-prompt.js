// Create a `Human` constructor function that takes in a name 
// and creates an object with that `name` and an `age` of 0
// The `Human` object should also have a method called `birthday`
//
// `birthday` takes in a number and adds that many years to the `age` property
// and then console logs out a congratulatory message containing the name of
// the human and their new age





// Create a new Human object with a name of "asher" and store it inside
// the variable `asher`




// Call on the `birthday` method of `asher` to increase their `age` by 1 
// and add a new method `talk` to `Human` by using the `prototype` property
//
// `talk` should be a function that takes in no arguments and console logs "Ma. Da."





// Call on the `talk` method of `asher`



// Call on the `birthday` method of `asher` to increase their `age` by 1 
// and add a new method `walk` to `Human` by using the `prototype` property
//
// `walk` should be a function that takes in no arguments and console logs "asher walked!"





// Call on the `walk` method of `asher`




// Call on the `birthday` method of `asher` to increase their `age` by 1 
// Change the talk method of `Human` to console log "Hello, my name is " followed by their name





// Call on the `talk` method of `asher`




// Call on the `birthday` method of `asher` to increase their `age` by 4
// Add a new property `school` to `asher` and set it to "elementary"
//
// Do not use `prototype` when you're changing the property of an instance of an object




// Change the talk method of `asher` to console log 
// "Hello, my name is asher and I go to {school} school!"
// where {school} is the school property of `asher`





// Call on the `talk` method of `asher`




// Create a new Human object with a name of "joy" and store it inside
// the variable `joy`




// Console log out the values of the `age` and `school` properties of `joy`




// Call on the `walk` method of `joy`




// Call on the `talk` method of `joy`




// Why is the `talk` method different for `joy` than for `asher`?
