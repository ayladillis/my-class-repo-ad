given string 's' reverse it

example:
s = "hello world"
return = "dlrow olleh"

step 1
iterate throgh the s string 
for loop
reverse string

step 2
use upshift to move from the end to begining of the string
for { i = 0; 1 >=; i--}
start with the last letter first

step 3
create empty string to add reversed letters too

step 4 
call the new reversed string 



given 2 stirngs s1 and s2 return a string /char array consisting of char that are common between s1 and s2,
it should not have repeated chars

1. 
example 
s1 = "i love cats"
s2= "i love dogs"

return = "i love"

2. 
compare s1 and s2 with eachother 
nested for loop
identify common chars

3. 
create an empty string 
place the common chars in 

4. 
return the new string with common chars
call on the 'return' string

<!-- another way -->

two non nested for loops, move arrays into bjects
