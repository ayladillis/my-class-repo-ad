# **04-PublishPackage**

We're ready to publish our package! Our final step is to write... A `README.md` and update our **`package.json.`** After completing the following, you can look at the `/Solved` folder for reference.

1. In your `/google` directory, create a `README.md` file.

    **`touch README.md`**

2. Title your README with the name of your **npm** package name.
    
    `# @yourusername/google`

3. Add a small description section that describes what the package may do.

4. Add an **Installation** section and indicate the steps to download your package.

    ```markdown

    # Installation

    ` npm install @yourusername/google` 

    ```

5. Add a **Usage** or **Examples** section that demonstrates how the package should work.

    **Example:** 

    ```js
        var google = require('@yourusername/google');

        var avengersSearch = google.search(["captain america", "thor", "black widow", "captain america", "captain america", "iron man", "quicksilver", "spiderman", "starlord", "captain america", "ant man", "dr. strange", "thanos", "captain marvel", "gamora", "hulk", "nebula", "hawkeye", "vision", "scarlet witch"], "captain america"));

        // { positions: [ 0, 3, 4, 9 ], count: 4, time: '0.13' }

        console.log(`Your search took ${avengersSearch.time}s long to execute.`)
        // Your search took 0.13s long to execute.

    ```
## **Update `package.json` and add MIT License**

6. Go to your **`package.json.`** and make sure you have a *description*, that your *license* is listed as "MIT," and add few *keywords* (as strings) that others can use to search for your package.
    - Also, make sure your *main* is **google.js**.

7. In the root directory of your **/google** directory, make a **LICENSE** file and copy the following into it:


    ```
    MIT License
