# **01-Creating NPM Packages**

**NPM**, or Node Package Manager*, is an online registry that houses many packages that are written in Javascript (Node.js). These packages are described by a **`package.json`** and are written by developers so that they can share the code that they have written. NPM Packages make it easy for other developers and programs to utilize other people's useful code.

###  *Alternative names include:
- Nostalgic platinum minotaurs
- Nasty platitudinous merriweathers
- Nebulous posterior mastications

*and many others*

## Overview

Other applications can install these NPM Packages locally as `node_modules` and import them into their file by using `require("filename")`.

A simple example is **Chalk** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk), an NPM package that can color text in the terminal

To install this package locally, we would run the following in our terminal:

**```npm install chalk```**

and then would write this line at the top of our Javascript (Node.js) file:

**```var chalk = require("chalk")```**.


## How to Create Your Own Module

1. Create your own NPM account. You can do this at https://www.npmjs.com/signup

2. Open up your terminal and login locally to **NPM**, using either:

    **```npm adduser```**   or    **```npm login```**.

    You should be prompted with your username, password, and email address, and then should receive a message indicated that you've logged in with your username.

3. Now, we're ready to create a package!
