// returns an array of command line arguments
console.log(process.argv);

// console.log(process.argv[2]);


// ☝️ How does the command line input relate to the output?

// 🙋 Arguments entered at the command line are added to the returned array as individual elements.

// ☝️ What is happening when we wrap quotes around multiple words?

// 🙋 Wrapping several words in quotes returns them as one element in the array, rather than individual elements.

// ☝️ What does it mean for us if we can pass arguments to our Node application?

// 🙋 We can work with those values to create dynamic, interactive applications.
