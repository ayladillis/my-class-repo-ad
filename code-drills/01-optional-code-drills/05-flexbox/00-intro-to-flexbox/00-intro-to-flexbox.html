   WHAT IS FLEXBOX?
   ===============================================================

   Before the Flexbox Layout module, there were four layout modes:

      - Block, for sections in a webpage
      - Inline, for text
      - Table, for two-dimensional table data
      - Positioned, for explicit positioning of an element

   The Flexbox Layout module makes it easier to design flexible, responsive layout structures without using float or positioning.


   In other words, Flexbox is going to be a LIFESAVER when you want to position elements in your HTML. This does not mean that you will never use the other strategies listed above, but Flexbox is oftentimes the best tool for positioning elements, especially when you are trying to center something or create an evenly spaced grid of elements.
